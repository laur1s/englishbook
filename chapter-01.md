Dr. Meredith Grey woke up very early. Today was her first day at Seattle Grace Hospital. Her heart was beating fast. She was very nervous. She put on her white coat and looked in the mirror. "You can do this," she said to herself.

When she arrived, the hospital was huge and very busy. People in blue and green scrubs were walking fast everywhere. Nurses were pushing beds. Doctors were talking loudly on phones. Everything smelled like medicine and cleaning products.

Meredith walked to the locker room. Five new interns were starting today. Everyone looked scared and nervous. Suddenly, a tall man with gray hair came in. It was Dr. Webber, the chief of surgery.

"Welcome to Seattle Grace," Dr. Webber said in a serious voice. "You will work very, very hard here. You will make mistakes. But you can become good doctors."

Meredith's first job was to check patients. Her first patient was Mr. Johnson. He was an old man with white hair. He had hip surgery yesterday.

"Hello, Mr. Johnson," Meredith said. She tried to speak with confidence (pasitikėjimas savimi). "I'm Dr. Grey. How do you feel?"

Mr. Johnson looked at her. "You look very young. Are you really a doctor?"

Meredith smiled. "Yes, I'm 26. I'm a real doctor."

Mr. Johnson laughed. "OK, good luck. Be careful - the old nurses here are very tough!"

Meredith checked his temperature, blood pressure, and pulse. Everything was good. "You're doing well," she told him.

Later, Meredith went to the cafeteria for lunch. She saw other doctors there. A woman with dark hair called her over. "Hi, I'm Cristina Yang. You're new, right?"

"Yes, I'm Meredith Grey. First day," she answered.

Cristina pointed at a handsome man. "That's Alex Karev. He makes jokes but he can be mean (nemalonus). And that's Izzie Stevens. She's very nice."

Izzie smiled. "Welcome! Don't worry. We were all new once. What do you want to study?"

"Surgery," Meredith said. "I want to learn everything."

Alex laughed. "Good luck. This hospital is very difficult."

The day was very long. Meredith checked more patients. She wrote reports (ataskaitos). She learned how to use the computer. By evening, she was so tired. But she was also excited.

When she drove home, Meredith thought about her day. The hospital was difficult and big. But she felt happy there. "This is just the beginning," she thought. "Tomorrow will be better."

But she didn't know that her life at Seattle Grace was going to change everything.
