Hospital</h2>
<h2 id="skyrius-pirmoji-diena-ligoninėje">1 Skyrius: Pirmoji Diena
Ligoninėje</h2>
<p>Dr. Meredith Grey arrived at Seattle Grace Hospital on her first day.
She was nervous (nervinga) but excited. The hospital was big and busy.
People in white coats walked quickly through the halls. Meredith met her
boss, Dr. Richard Webber. He was the chief (vyriausias) of surgery.</p>
<p>“Welcome to the hospital,” Dr. Webber said. “You will work hard here,
but it will be worth it.”</p>
<p>Meredith’s first job was simple. She had to check a patient’s
temperature and blood pressure (kraujo spaudimas). The patient was an
old man named Mr. Johnson. He smiled at Meredith.</p>
<p>“You look young to be a doctor,” he said.</p>
<p>“I’m just starting,” Meredith replied. “I want to help people.”</p>
<p>During lunch, Meredith met other doctors. Dr. Cristina Yang was very
smart and serious. Dr. Alex Karev was funny but sometimes rude
(nemandagus). Dr. Izzie Stevens was kind and beautiful. They became
friends quickly.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, Meredith felt tired but happy. “This is my
place,” she thought. “I belong here.”</p>

<h2 id="chapter-2-the-emergency-room">Chapter 2: The Emergency Room</h2>
<h2 id="skyrius-skubios-pagalbos-skyrius">2 Skyrius: Skubios Pagalbos
Skyrius</h2>
<p>It was a busy night in the emergency room (skubios pagalbos skyrius).
An ambulance (greitoji pagalba) brought in a young woman. She had been
in a car accident. Her name was Sarah, and she was hurt badly.
Dr. Meredith Grey was on duty.</p>
<p>Sarah was crying. “My leg hurts! Please help me!”</p>
<p>Meredith checked Sarah’s injuries. Her leg was broken, and she had
cuts on her face. “Don’t worry,” Meredith said. “We’ll take care of
you.”</p>
<p>Dr. Cristina Yang helped Meredith. Cristina was good at surgery
(chirurgija). Together, they fixed Sarah’s leg. It was hard work, but
they saved her.</p>
<p>Sarah’s family arrived later. Her husband and two children were
worried. “Will she be okay?” the husband asked.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Meredith said. “She needs rest, but she’ll recover
(pasveikti).”</p>
<p>After the surgery, Meredith felt proud. She had helped someone in
need. But she was also tired. Working in the emergency room was
stressful (stresinis).</p>
<p>Dr. Alex Karev made a joke. “Good job, Grey. You’re not bad for a
beginner.”</p>
<p>Meredith smiled. “Thanks, Karev. We make a good team.”</p>

<h2 id="chapter-3-love-in-the-hospital">Chapter 3: Love in the
Hospital</h2>
<h2 id="skyrius-meilė-ligoninėje">3 Skyrius: Meilė Ligoninėje</h2>
<p>Dr. Meredith Grey had a secret. She was dating (susitikinėti)
Dr. Derek Shepherd. Derek was a famous brain surgeon (smegenų
chirurgas). They worked together, but kept their relationship hidden
(paslėpta).</p>
<p>One day, Derek had a difficult surgery. A patient had a brain tumor
(auglys smegenyse). The surgery was risky (rizikinga). Meredith watched
from outside the operating room.</p>
<p>“Please be careful,” Meredith whispered to herself.</p>
<p>The surgery lasted six hours. Derek was tired but successful. The
patient would live.</p>
<p>After the surgery, Meredith found Derek in the doctors’ lounge
(poilsio kambarys). “You were amazing,” she said.</p>
<p>Derek smiled. “Thanks. I couldn’t do it without my team.”</p>
<p>But their relationship was complicated. Hospital rules said doctors
shouldn’t date each other. If anyone found out, they could get in
trouble.</p>
<p>Dr. Izzie Stevens suspected something. She saw Meredith and Derek
looking at each other strangely. “Are you two…?” she started to ask.</p>
<p>“No,” Meredith said quickly. “We’re just colleagues
(bendradarbiai).”</p>
<p>Izzie didn’t believe her, but she didn’t say anything. Some secrets
are better kept.</p>
<p>Meredith and Derek decided to be careful. Their love was important,
but so were their jobs.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-4-the-miracle-baby">Chapter 4: The Miracle Baby</h2>
<h2 id="skyrius-stebuklingas-kūdikis">4 Skyrius: Stebuklingas
Kūdikis</h2>
<p>Dr. Addison Montgomery arrived at Seattle Grace Hospital. She was a
specialist in babies and pregnancy (nėštumas). A pregnant woman named
Lisa was having problems.</p>
<p>Lisa was 35 weeks pregnant. Her baby wasn’t growing properly. The
doctors were worried. “The baby might not survive (išgyventi),”
Dr. Addison said.</p>
<p>Lisa cried. “Please save my baby! I want to be a mother so much.”</p>
<p>Dr. Meredith Grey helped Dr. Addison. They did tests and found the
problem. The baby needed special medicine.</p>
<p>The delivery (gimdymas) was difficult. Lisa pushed hard, and the
doctors helped. Finally, a healthy baby boy was born! He weighed only 2
kilograms, but he was strong.</p>
<p>Lisa held her baby and cried tears of joy. “He’s beautiful,” she
said.</p>
<p>The doctors were happy too. Dr. Addison hugged Meredith. “We did it!
We saved two lives today.”</p>
<p>Meredith learned something important. Medicine is about hope and
teamwork. Sometimes miracles happen.</p>
<p>But not all stories end happily. Another patient, an old woman,
passed away (mirė) that day. Her family was sad. Meredith comforted
them. “She lived a long life,” she said. “She was loved.”</p>
<p>Hospital life has both joy and sorrow (liūdesys).</p>

<h2 id="skyrius-draugystė-ir-palaikymas">5 Skyrius: Draugystė ir

<p>Dr. Cristina Yang was having a bad day. Her patient died during
surgery. Cristina felt guilty (kaltas). She blamed herself.</p>
<p>“I’m not a good doctor,” Cristina thought. “I made a mistake.”</p>
<p>Dr. Meredith Grey saw her friend was upset. She took Cristina to the
hospital cafeteria (valgykla). “Talk to me,” Meredith said.</p>
<p>Cristina cried. “I tried to save him, but I couldn’t. What if I’m not
good enough?”</p>
<p>Meredith hugged her. “You’re an excellent doctor. Everyone makes
mistakes. It’s part of learning.”</p>
<p>Dr. Alex Karev joined them. He was usually joking, but today he was
serious. “Cristina, you did everything right. Sometimes patients don’t
survive. It’s not your fault.”</p>
<p>Dr. Izzie Stevens brought coffee. “We’re a team,” she said. “We
support each other.”</p>
<p>The friends talked for hours. They shared their fears and dreams.
Cristina felt better. Friendship made the hard days easier.</p>
<p>Later, Meredith thought about her own problems. Her relationship with
Derek was still secret. But she had good friends. They were like
family.</p>
<p>In the hospital, doctors face death and illness every day. But they
also find friendship and love. That’s what keeps them going.</p>
<p>Cristina decided to try again. “Tomorrow is a new day,” she said.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-6-new-beginnings">Chapter 6: New Beginnings</h2>
<h2 id="skyrius-nauji-pradžiai">6 Skyrius: Nauji Pradžiai</h2>
<p>A year had passed at Seattle Grace Hospital. Dr. Meredith Grey was
more confident (pasitikintis savimi). She had learned so much.</p>
<p>One day, a new intern (praktikantas) arrived. Her name was Dr. Lexie
Grey. She was Meredith’s half-sister! They didn’t know each other
before.</p>
<p>Lexie was excited but nervous. “I can’t believe I have a sister,” she
said.</p>
<p>Meredith was surprised. “Me neither. But I’m glad you’re here.”</p>
<p>The sisters worked together. Lexie was smart and eager to learn.
Meredith taught her about the hospital.</p>
<p>Dr. Derek Shepherd proposed (pasipiršo) to Meredith. “Will you marry
me?” he asked.</p>
<p>Meredith said yes. They would get married in the hospital garden. All
their friends would come.</p>
<p>But hospital life continued. There were always new patients and
challenges. Dr. Richard Webber retired (išeiti į pensiją). Dr. Owen Hunt
became the new chief.</p>
<p>Change is part of life, Meredith learned. Some things end, but new
things begin.</p>
<p>Meredith thought about her journey. From a nervous intern to a
confident doctor. From alone to having a family. The hospital had
changed her life.</p>
<p>“I love this place,” Meredith said. “It’s where I found myself.”</p>

<h2 id="chapter-7-the-big-storm">Chapter 7: The Big Storm</h2>
<h2 id="skyrius-didžioji-audra">7 Skyrius: Didžioji Audra</h2>
<p>A big storm hit Seattle. The hospital was busy. Power went out, and
it was dark. Doctors used flashlights (žibintuvėliai).</p>
<p>Dr. Meredith Grey was in the emergency room. A man fell from a ladder
during the storm. His arm was broken badly.</p>
<p>“We need to operate now,” Meredith said.</p>
<p>But without power, the operating room was dangerous. Dr. Cristina
Yang found a backup generator (atsarginis generatorius).</p>
<p>The surgery was successful. The man would keep his arm.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, patients were scared. Children cried. Families
worried.</p>
<p>Dr. Izzie Stevens comforted a little girl. “Don’t worry,” she said.
“The doctors will help you.”</p>
<p>Dr. Alex Karev helped an old woman. “You’re safe here,” he said.</p>
<p>The storm lasted all night. Doctors worked without sleep. They were
heroes.</p>
<p>In the morning, the sun came out. The hospital was damaged, but
everyone was alive.</p>
<p>Meredith hugged her friends. “We did it,” she said.</p>

<p>Dr. Meredith Grey had a dream. She wanted to be the best surgeon. But
reality was different. Medicine was hard work.</p>
<p>One day, a famous doctor visited Seattle Grace. Dr. Catherine Avery
was a legend (legenda). She was Derek’s mother!</p>
<p>Catherine watched Meredith operate. “You’re talented,” she said. “But
you need more experience.”</p>
<p>Meredith felt proud but also unsure. “I want to be great,” she
said.</p>
<p>Catherine gave advice. “Medicine is about heart and skill. Never give
up.”</p>
<p>Meredith thought about her dreams. She wanted to save lives and help
people. But she also wanted a family.</p>
<p>Derek supported her. “You can have both,” he said.</p>
<p>Dr. Cristina Yang had dreams too. She wanted to be a heart surgeon.
She studied hard.</p>
<p>Alex wanted to be better. He was rude sometimes, but he cared about
patients.</p>
<p>Izzie dreamed of helping poor people. She wanted to be a better
doctor.</p>
<p>Dreams keep doctors going. But reality teaches them to be strong.</p>
<p>Meredith learned that being a doctor means balancing dreams and
reality.</p>
