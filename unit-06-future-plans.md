## Tips for Lithuanian Speakers / Patarimai lietuviams

⚠️ **Common mistakes:**
1. Don't forget "to" in "going to": "I'm going study" ✗ → "I'm going to study" ✓
2. Will is the same for all subjects: "He wills" ✗ → "He will" ✓
3. Use "going to" for plans, "will" for spontaneous decisions
4. Don't use "will" + "to": "will to go" ✗ → "will go" ✓

**Lithuanian vs English:**
- Lithuanian has one main future tense
- English distinguishes between "going to" (planned) and "will" (spontaneous/predictions)
- English future is simpler to form than Lithuanian future

**Remember:**
- **Going to** = ateities laikas (suplanuotas)
- **Will** = būsimasis laikas (prognozė, spontaniškas sprendimas)
