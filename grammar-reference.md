## Tips for Lithuanian Learners

1. **Always use articles** - Lithuanian doesn't have them, but English needs a/an/the
2. **Use auxiliary verbs** - Don't forget do/does/did in questions and negatives
3. **Include "to be"** - Never omit am/is/are/was/were
4. **Word order is fixed** - Subject + Verb + Object in English
5. **One negative per sentence** - Use "any" with negative, not "no"
6. **Learn irregular verbs** - They don't follow patterns
7. **-s for he/she/it** - Don't forget in Present Simple
8. **Prepositions are different** - Learn English prepositions, don't translate from Lithuanian
