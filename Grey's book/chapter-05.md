Cristina Yang was always the strongest doctor at the hospital. She never cried. She never showed fear. She was like a machine - strong, smart, and perfect. But today, everything changed.

Today, Cristina's patient died.

His name was George. He was 55 years old. He had heart problems. Cristina was doing heart surgery on him. The surgery started well. Everything was going perfectly. Cristina was confident. "This will be easy," she thought.

But then, suddenly, George's heart stopped.

"His heart stopped!" a nurse shouted. "We're losing him!"

Cristina worked fast. She did CPR. She tried everything. Forty-five minutes passed. Cristina was sweating. Her hands were shaking. But nothing worked.

George was dead.

"Time of death: 3:47 PM," Cristina said quietly. Her voice was shaking.

She stood there, looking at George's body. The monitor showed a flat line. No heartbeat. Just silence. Cristina couldn't move. She couldn't breathe. This was her patient. And now he was dead.

In the scrub room, Cristina finally broke down. She fell against the wall and started crying. She was crying so hard that she couldn't stand up. She slid down to the floor.

"I killed him!" Cristina was sobbing. "It's my fault! I did something wrong! I killed him!"

Her hands were shaking. She couldn't stop crying. Strong, perfect Cristina was completely broken.

Meredith was walking past when she heard the crying. She ran into the scrub room and saw her best friend on the floor, crying like a child.

"Cristina!" Meredith sat down next to her on the floor. "What happened?"

Cristina could barely speak. "He died... George died... on my table... I tried everything... but I couldn't save him..." She looked at Meredith with terrified eyes. "What if I'm a bad doctor? What if I kill more people? Maybe I should quit!"

Meredith grabbed Cristina's hands. "No! Listen to me! You're an amazing doctor! Sometimes patients die. It's not always your fault. You did everything right."

"But he's DEAD!" Cristina screamed. "He came here to get better, and now he's DEAD because of me!"

Just then, Alex walked in. He saw Cristina crying on the floor. Usually, Alex made jokes about everything. But not today. Today, he sat down next to them.

"Cristina," Alex said gently. "I looked at George's chart. His heart was too damaged. No doctor in the world could have saved him. Not even the best surgeon. You gave him a chance. That's all anyone could do."

Izzie came in with coffee and sandwiches. She heard what happened and wanted to help. She sat down on the floor with them. Now all four friends were sitting on the floor together.

"We're here for you," Izzie said softly. "Remember two months ago when I lost my first patient? I cried for three days. You helped me then. Now we're going to help you."

They sat together for a long time. They talked about their fears. They talked about their failures.

Cristina told them about her parents. "My parents moved to America with nothing. They worked three jobs so I could go to medical school. They believed in me. What will I tell them now? That I failed?"

Meredith shared her own fears. "My mother was a famous surgeon. Everyone expects me to be perfect like her. But I'm not perfect. I make mistakes every day. I'm scared I'll never be good enough."

Alex surprised everyone. "Sometimes I feel like a fake," he said quietly. "Like one day, everyone will discover I'm not really smart enough to be a doctor."

Izzie added, "I worry that being a doctor is taking over my whole life. I have no time for anything else. No time for friends. No time for love. Just work, work, work."

Slowly, Cristina stopped crying. Her friends' words were helping. She wasn't alone. They all had fears. They all had failures. But they had each other.

"Thank you," Cristina said finally. Her voice was still shaking, but she wasn't crying anymore. "I don't know what I would do without you."

"That's what friends are for," Meredith said, hugging her. "We're not just colleagues. We're family."

Later, Cristina went back to work. She was still sad. George's death still hurt. But she felt stronger. She had friends who understood. She had friends who cared.

That night, as Meredith drove home, she thought about friendship. Being a doctor was so hard. Patients died. Mistakes happened. But having good friends made it possible to continue.

"Friendship saves us," Meredith thought. "Not just patients. But us too."
