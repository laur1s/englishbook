Two years had passed since Meredith's first day at Seattle Grace Hospital. The nervous intern had become a confident surgeon. She had faced countless emergencies, lost patients she couldn't save, and celebrated victories that seemed miraculous. Through it all, Meredith had grown stronger, more compassionate, and deeply committed to her calling.

One crisp autumn morning, a new group of interns arrived. Among them was Dr. Lexie Grey, a bright-eyed 25-year-old with an infectious enthusiasm. As Meredith reviewed the interns' files, she froze. Lexie Grey. The name was familiar. Too familiar.

During orientation, Meredith pulled Lexie aside. "Your last name is Grey?" she asked, trying to keep her voice steady.

Lexie nodded excitedly. "Yes! Dr. Ellis Grey was my mother. She passed away a few years ago. I came to Seattle Grace because this was her hospital."

Meredith's heart raced. Dr. Ellis Grey had been her mother too - a brilliant surgeon who chose her career over her family. Meredith had never known she had a half-sister. "I'm... I'm Meredith," she stammered. "Meredith Grey. Your half-sister."

Lexie's eyes widened in shock and joy. "You? My sister? This is incredible!" They embraced, both women crying happy tears.

The sisters spent hours talking that night. Lexie shared stories of their mother's brilliance and occasional coldness. Meredith confessed how Ellis's abandonment had shaped her life. Despite the pain of their mother's choices, they found comfort in each other.

At work, Meredith mentored Lexie, teaching her the intricacies of surgical procedures and patient care. Lexie was eager, intelligent, and brought fresh energy to the team. "You're going to be an amazing doctor," Meredith told her.

Meanwhile, Meredith's relationship with Derek had deepened. After years of secrecy and challenges, Derek planned the perfect proposal. One evening, as the sun set over the hospital garden, he got down on one knee. "Meredith Grey, will you marry me?"

Tears streamed down Meredith's face as she nodded. "Yes," she whispered. "A thousand times yes."

Their wedding was intimate and beautiful, held in the very garden where they first confessed their love. Cristina was Meredith's maid of honor, Alex walked Derek down the aisle, and Izzie handled the flowers. Even Dr. Webber, though retired, officiated the ceremony.

But hospital life never stopped. Even on their wedding day, there was an emergency appendectomy that Derek had to perform. "Duty calls," he said with a smile.

Dr. Richard Webber's retirement created another change. The board appointed Dr. Owen Hunt as the new chief of surgery. Owen was a military trauma surgeon - intense, disciplined, and sometimes intimidating.

Change brought growth, Meredith realized. Lexie's arrival healed old wounds. Her marriage to Derek brought stability. Owen's leadership brought new energy. Some chapters ended, but new ones began.

As Meredith looked around at her wedding reception - her new husband, her sister, her friends - she felt truly blessed. Seattle Grace had taken her in as a stranger and given her a family. The hospital wasn't just a workplace; it was home.

Meredith thought about her journey. From a nervous intern to a confident doctor. From alone to having a family. The hospital had changed her life.

"I love this place," Meredith said. "It's where I found myself."
