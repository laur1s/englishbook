It was Friday night. The emergency room was always busy on Fridays, but tonight was crazy. Ambulances were arriving one after another. Sirens were screaming outside. Dr. Meredith Grey was very tired. She wanted to go home. But then the doors opened fast.

"We need help NOW!" a nurse shouted.

A young woman was on a stretcher. Her name was Sarah. She was only 28 years old. She was a teacher. She had two small children at home. Blood was everywhere - on her clothes, on her face, on the stretcher. She was screaming.

"My leg! Oh God, my leg!" Sarah was crying so hard. "Please help me! It hurts so much!"

Meredith ran to her. Her heart was beating fast. "I'm Dr. Grey. You're safe now. What happened?"

Sarah could barely speak. "A drunk driver... hit my car... I was driving home from work... Please... my babies... tell my babies Mommy is OK!"

Meredith looked at Sarah's leg. It was very, very bad. The leg was broken in a terrible way. It was bent wrong. There was so much blood. Sarah also had deep cuts on her arms and face from the broken glass.

"We need surgery NOW!" Meredith shouted. "Call Dr. Yang immediately!"

Dr. Cristina Yang ran into the room. She looked at Sarah's X-rays. Her face became very serious. "This is bad. The leg is broken in two places. We need to operate now or she will lose her leg."

Suddenly, a man ran into the emergency room. It was Mark, Sarah's husband. His face was white. He looked terrified. "Where is my wife? Is she alive? The police called me... they said it was very bad!"

"She's alive," Meredith said. "But we need to do surgery right now. Your wife's leg is badly broken. We're going to try to save it."

Mark started crying. "Can I see her? Our children... they're so scared. They don't understand what happened."

"You can see her for one minute," Meredith said. "Then we must take her to surgery."

Mark held Sarah's hand. "I'm here, honey. The doctors are going to help you. The kids are OK. They're with your mother. You're going to be OK."

Sarah looked at him with scared eyes. "Promise me... if something happens... promise you'll take care of our babies..."

"Don't talk like that!" Mark was crying harder now. "You're going to be fine! You have to be fine!"

They took Sarah to the operating room. The surgery was very difficult. It took three long hours. Cristina worked very carefully. Meredith helped her. They had to work fast but also very carefully. One wrong move and Sarah could lose her leg forever.

Inside the operating room, suddenly something went wrong. Sarah's blood pressure dropped very fast.

"We're losing her!" Cristina shouted. "Give me more blood! NOW!"

Meredith's hands were shaking. This was life or death. "Come on, Sarah," she whispered. "Fight! Your children need you!"

After three terrible hours, the surgery was finished. They saved Sarah's leg. When Sarah woke up, she was confused and very tired from the medicine.

"My leg?" she asked quietly. "Do I still have my leg?"

Cristina smiled. "Yes. Your leg is fixed. You'll need to work hard in physical therapy (fizinė terapija), but you will walk again."

Sarah started crying - but this time, these were happy tears.

Mark brought their children to see her. The little girl, only 5 years old, climbed very carefully onto the bed. "Mommy! You're OK!" She hugged her mother so gently.

"The doctors saved Mommy," Sarah said, crying. "I'm going to be OK."

Meredith watched them from the door. She was so tired. But she felt wonderful. This family was together again because of what they did tonight.

Later, Alex Karev found Meredith in the hallway. "Hey, Grey. You did great tonight. That woman almost died. You saved her life."

Meredith was too tired to even smile. "We saved her together. That's what we do here."

When Meredith finally drove home, it was 3 AM. She thought about Sarah and her family. The emergency room was difficult and emotional. But tonight, they won. They saved a mother's life.

But tomorrow, there would be another emergency. Another life to save. Another battle to fight.
