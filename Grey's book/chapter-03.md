Meredith had a big secret. A very big secret. She was in love with Dr. Derek Shepherd. Derek was a brain surgeon - the best brain surgeon at Seattle Grace Hospital. He was handsome, smart, and kind. But there was a huge problem.

Hospital rules said doctors cannot date other doctors. If their boss found out, Meredith and Derek could lose their jobs. They could be fired. So they kept their love secret. Nobody knew - not their friends, not their family, nobody.

Every day at work was so hard. They had to act like they were just colleagues. They couldn't hold hands. They couldn't kiss. They couldn't even stand too close to each other. But sometimes, their eyes met across the room. And in those moments, Meredith felt her heart beat faster.

One Wednesday morning, Derek had a very dangerous surgery. His patient was Robert, a 45-year-old man. Robert had a big brain tumor. The tumor was growing in a very bad place. If Derek made even one small mistake, Robert could die or never walk again.

Meredith wasn't working on this surgery. But she was so worried about Derek. She stood outside the operating room and watched through the glass window. Her hands were shaking. Her heart was beating so fast.

Derek made the first cut. The surgery began. It was so dangerous. One wrong move and everything could go wrong.

"Please, Derek," Meredith whispered to the window. "Please be careful. Please come back to me safely."

The surgery took seven long hours. Meredith couldn't leave. She walked back and forth in the hallway. She drank five cups of coffee. She was so scared. What if something happened to Derek? What if the surgery went wrong?

She loved Derek so much. He made her feel alive. He made her feel special. But their secret love was also making her crazy with worry. What if someone discovered their secret? What if they got caught?

Finally, after seven hours, the operating room doors opened. Derek walked out. He looked so tired. But he was smiling!

"The surgery was successful," Derek told Robert's family. "The tumor is out. He's going to be OK."

Meredith wanted to run to Derek and hug him. She wanted to kiss him. But she couldn't. Not here. Not in front of everyone. So she waited.

Later, Meredith found Derek in the doctors' lounge. She quickly closed the door behind her. They were finally alone.

"You were amazing today," Meredith said. She was almost crying. "I was so scared."

"I was scared too," Derek said. "But I kept thinking about you. I kept thinking about us. And that gave me strength."

They kissed. It was a beautiful kiss. But it was also a dangerous kiss. Anyone could open the door and see them. Anyone could discover their secret.

Suddenly, the door handle moved! Someone was coming in! Meredith and Derek jumped away from each other fast. It was Dr. Izzie Stevens. She looked at them strangely.

"Oh, sorry," Izzie said. "I didn't know anyone was here."

"We were just talking about the surgery," Derek said quickly. Too quickly.

Izzie smiled, but her smile was strange. "OK. See you later." She left.

Meredith's heart was beating crazy fast. "Do you think she knows?" she asked Derek.

"I don't know," Derek said. "But we need to be more careful."

The next day at lunch, Izzie sat down next to Meredith. "We need to talk," Izzie said quietly.

Meredith felt sick. "About what?"

"About you and Derek," Izzie said. "I know you're together. I can see it in the way you look at each other. I saw you in the lounge yesterday. You two were very close."

Meredith's face went red. "Izzie, please... we're not... it's not..."

"Stop lying," Izzie said, but she wasn't angry. "I'm not going to tell anyone. But you need to be careful. If the chief finds out, you could both lose everything."

Meredith started crying. "I know. I know it's dangerous. But I love him, Izzie. I really love him. What should I do?"

Izzie took Meredith's hand. "I don't know. Love in a hospital is always complicated. Just be careful, OK?"

That night, Meredith met Derek at a restaurant far from the hospital. They sat in a dark corner where nobody could see them.

"This is so hard," Meredith said. "I hate hiding. I hate lying to everyone."

"I know," Derek said. "But we'll find a way. Maybe I can transfer to a different department. Or maybe hospital rules will change."

"But what if they never change?" Meredith asked. "What if we have to choose between our jobs and each other?"

Derek took her hand. "Then we'll make that choice when we need to. But right now, all I know is that I love you. And I'm not going to give up on us."

Meredith looked into his eyes. She was scared. Their love was dangerous. Their love was forbidden. But it was also real. And beautiful.

"I love you too," she said. "No matter what happens."

But as they left the restaurant, Meredith had a bad feeling. How long could they keep this secret? And what would happen when the secret came out?
