Dr. Addison Montgomery was a baby doctor - the best baby doctor at Seattle Grace Hospital. She helped mothers have babies. Usually, she helped when something was very wrong with the pregnancy.

On Tuesday morning, a woman arrived at the hospital. Her name was Lisa Thompson. She was 32 years old and pregnant. But something was very wrong. Very, very wrong.

Lisa had tried to have a baby for five years. Five long years. She had many problems. She had lost two babies before they were born. This baby was her last chance. Her only chance.

When Addison looked at the ultrasound, her face became serious. The baby was too small. Much too small. The baby wasn't growing. The baby was in danger.

"Please," Lisa was crying so hard. "Please save my baby. I've been waiting for five years. Five years! This is my last chance. Please, doctor, please!"

Lisa's husband, Tom, was holding her hand. He was crying too. "We can't lose another baby," he said. "We just can't. Please help us."

Addison looked at Meredith. "We need to deliver this baby now. Right now. If we wait, the baby will die inside the mother."

"But the baby is only 35 weeks old," Meredith said. "That's too early. The baby is too small. Can the baby survive?"

"I don't know," Addison said honestly. "But if we don't try, the baby will definitely die."

They took Lisa to the operating room. Tom couldn't come with them. He had to wait outside. He sat in the waiting room and cried. He prayed (meldėsi). He hoped for a miracle.

In the operating room, Addison began the surgery. She cut very carefully. "The baby is coming," she said. "The baby is so small. So, so small."

The baby came out. It was a boy. But he was so tiny. So tiny that he looked like a little doll. His skin was almost see-through (permatomna). His eyes were still closed. And he wasn't breathing.

"He's not breathing!" Meredith shouted. "The baby isn't breathing!"

Addison worked fast. She cleaned the baby's mouth. She rubbed his chest. "Come on, baby. Breathe. Please breathe!"

For three terrible seconds, nothing happened. The room was silent. Everyone was holding their breath.

Then - suddenly - the baby made a small sound. A tiny cry.

"He's breathing!" Meredith almost screamed. "He's alive!"

But the baby was still in danger. He was too small. Too weak. They rushed him to the NICU - the special room for very sick babies. The baby needed machines to help him breathe. He needed special care.

When Lisa woke up from the surgery, the first thing she said was: "My baby? Where is my baby? Is he alive?"

Addison sat next to her bed. "Your baby is alive. But he's very sick, Lisa. He's very, very small. The next two days will be critical (kritiški). We don't know if he will survive."

Lisa started crying. "Can I see him?"

"Not yet," Addison said. "He's too sick. But we're doing everything we can."

For two days and two nights, the baby was in critical condition. Addison and Meredith didn't go home. They stayed at the hospital. They watched the baby every minute. The baby needed a breathing machine. His heart was weak. He was so small - only 1.8 kilograms.

"Fight, little one," Meredith whispered to the baby. "Your mother is waiting for you. Your father is waiting for you. Please fight."

Tom and Lisa stayed in the hospital too. They couldn't sleep. They couldn't eat. They just waited and prayed.

On the morning of the third day, something amazing happened. The baby opened his eyes. His breathing got stronger. His heart rate got better.

"I think we can take him off the breathing machine," Addison said. Her hands were shaking. "Let's try."

They turned off the machine. Everyone held their breath. Would the baby breathe on his own?

One second. Two seconds. Three seconds.

And then - the baby took a breath! All by himself! And another breath! He was breathing alone!

"It's a miracle!" Meredith said. She was crying happy tears.

Addison ran to tell Lisa and Tom. "Your baby is breathing on his own! He's going to be OK! He's going to survive!"

Lisa couldn't stop crying. "Can I hold him now? Please, can I hold my baby?"

They brought the tiny baby to Lisa. She held him for the first time. He was so small that he fit in her two hands. But he was alive. Her baby was alive.

"Hello, my miracle baby," Lisa whispered. "I waited so long for you. Welcome to the world, my little fighter."

Tom was crying and smiling at the same time. "Thank you," he told the doctors. "You gave us our family. You gave us our dream."

Meredith felt so happy. This was why she became a doctor. To save lives. To make miracles happen.

But that same afternoon, something sad happened. An old woman in the hospital died. Her name was Mrs. Patterson. She was 87 years old. She had cancer. The doctors couldn't save her.

Meredith held the old woman's hand as she died. The woman's children were crying.

"Life and death," Meredith thought. "Both in the same day. A baby is born. An old woman dies. This is a hospital. This is medicine."

As Meredith walked home that night, she thought about Lisa's miracle baby. She thought about Mrs. Patterson. Hospitals have happy stories and sad stories. But today, at least one story had a happy ending. And that was enough.
