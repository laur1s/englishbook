## Chapter 1: First Day at the Hospital
## 1 Skyrius: Pirmoji Diena Ligoninėje

Dr. Meredith Grey woke up early on her first day at Seattle Grace Hospital. Her heart was beating fast. She had studied medicine for years, but now it was real. She put on her white coat and looked in the mirror. "You can do this," she told herself.

The hospital was huge and busy. People in blue and green scrubs walked quickly through the halls. Nurses pushed beds with patients. Doctors talked on phones. The air smelled like cleaning products and medicine.

Meredith found her way to the interns' locker room. She was one of five new interns starting today. They all looked nervous. A tall man with gray hair walked in. It was Dr. Richard Webber, the chief of surgery.

"Welcome to Seattle Grace," Dr. Webber said in a deep voice. "You will work harder than you ever have. You will make mistakes. But if you care about patients, you will become good doctors."

Meredith's first task was simple but important. She had to check vital signs on patients. Her first patient was Mr. Johnson, an old man with white hair. He was recovering from hip surgery.

"Hello, Mr. Johnson," Meredith said, trying to sound confident. "I'm Dr. Grey. How are you feeling today?"

Mr. Johnson looked at her over his glasses. "You look about twelve years old. Are you really a doctor?"

Meredith laughed. "I get that a lot. I'm 26, and yes, I'm a real doctor. I've been training for years."

Mr. Johnson smiled. "Well, good luck to you. Don't let the old nurses scare you. They're tougher than the doctors."

Meredith checked his temperature, blood pressure, and pulse. Everything looked good. "You're doing well, Mr. Johnson. The surgery was successful."

During her break, Meredith went to the cafeteria. She saw other doctors eating lunch. A serious-looking woman with dark hair waved her over. "Hi, I'm Cristina Yang. You must be new."

"I'm Meredith Grey," she replied. "Yes, first day."

Cristina pointed to a handsome man making jokes. "That's Alex Karev. He's funny but can be rude. And that's Izzie Stevens. She's kind and loves helping people."

Izzie smiled warmly. "Welcome to the team! Don't worry, we all started somewhere. What's your specialty?"

"General surgery," Meredith said. "I want to learn everything."

Alex leaned over. "Good luck with that. This place will chew you up and spit you out."

The day continued with more patient checks and paperwork. Meredith learned how to write in medical charts and use the hospital computer system. By evening, she was exhausted but excited.

As she drove home, Meredith thought about her day. The hospital was overwhelming, but she felt like she belonged there. "This is just the beginning," she thought. "Tomorrow will be better."

Little did she know that her life at Seattle Grace would change everything she thought about medicine, friendship, and love.

## Chapter 2: The Emergency Room
## 2 Skyrius: Skubios Pagalbos Skyrius

The emergency room at Seattle Grace Hospital was always busy, but this Friday night was especially chaotic. Sirens wailed outside as ambulances pulled up one after another. Dr. Meredith Grey was finishing her shift when the doors burst open.

A young woman named Sarah was rushed in on a stretcher. She was 28 years old, a teacher with two young children. Her car had been hit by a drunk driver. Blood covered her clothes, and she was screaming in pain.

"My leg! Oh God, my leg hurts so much!" Sarah cried. Tears streamed down her face.

Meredith rushed to her side. "I'm Dr. Grey. You're safe now. Can you tell me what happened?"

"A car... hit me... I was driving home from work," Sarah gasped. "Please, help my babies. Tell them Mommy's okay."

Meredith quickly assessed the situation. Sarah's right leg was clearly broken - it bent at an unnatural angle. There were also deep cuts on her arms and face from the broken glass. Her blood pressure was dropping, and she was going into shock.

"We need to get her to trauma room 2!" Meredith called out. "Page Dr. Yang for ortho surgery!"

Dr. Cristina Yang arrived within minutes. She was the best orthopedic surgeon at the hospital. Cristina examined Sarah's X-rays. "Compound fracture of the tibia and fibula. We'll need to operate immediately to save the leg."

Sarah's husband, Mark, arrived just as they were preparing her for surgery. He was frantic, his face pale with worry. Their two children, ages 5 and 7, waited in the waiting room with a nurse.

"Will she be okay?" Mark asked, his voice shaking. "The police said it was bad."

Meredith put her hand on his shoulder. "We're taking her to surgery now. Dr. Yang is the best. Sarah is in good hands. Your children are safe with our nurses."

The surgery lasted three hours. Cristina worked carefully to repair the broken bones. Meredith assisted, handing instruments and monitoring Sarah's vital signs. It was intense work, but they worked as a team.

When Sarah woke up in the recovery room, she was groggy from anesthesia but relieved. "My leg?" she whispered.

"It's fixed," Cristina said. "You'll need physical therapy, but you'll walk again. You're lucky - it could have been much worse."

Mark brought the children to see their mother. The little girl climbed carefully onto the bed and hugged Sarah gently. "Mommy, I was scared," she said.

"I'm okay, sweetheart," Sarah replied, tears in her eyes. "The doctors saved me."

Meredith watched from the doorway, feeling a deep sense of accomplishment. This was why she became a doctor - to help families through their darkest moments.

Later that night, as Meredith was leaving the hospital, Dr. Alex Karev caught up with her. "Hey, Grey. Heard you handled that trauma case well. Not bad for someone who's only been here a week."

Meredith smiled tiredly. "Thanks, Karev. It was intense, but we saved her leg."

Alex nodded. "That's what we do here. Patch people up and send them home. Sometimes we even get it right."

Meredith laughed despite her exhaustion. "You're impossible, but thanks for the compliment."

As she drove home under the city lights, Meredith reflected on her day. The emergency room was exhausting and emotional, but it was also where she felt most alive. Every patient was a story, every surgery a battle. She was beginning to understand that medicine wasn't just about science - it was about compassion, teamwork, and never giving up.

Little did she know that this was just the beginning of the challenges she would face at Seattle Grace.

## Chapter 3: Love in the Hospital
## 3 Skyrius: Meilė Ligoninėje

Dr. Meredith Grey had been keeping a big secret for months. She was in love with Dr. Derek Shepherd, one of the most talented brain surgeons at Seattle Grace Hospital. Derek was handsome, intelligent, and kind. They met when Meredith was still a medical student, and their connection was immediate.

Their relationship was passionate but complicated. Hospital rules strictly forbade doctors from dating each other. If their bosses found out, they could both lose their jobs or be transferred to different hospitals. So they kept their love hidden from everyone - their colleagues, friends, and even family.

Every day at work, Meredith and Derek had to act like professional colleagues only. They couldn't hold hands in the hallway or steal kisses in the elevator. But their eyes would meet across crowded rooms, and they shared secret smiles that only they understood.

One Wednesday morning, Derek was scheduled for a very difficult surgery. His patient was a 45-year-old man named Robert, who had a large brain tumor pressing on his brain stem. The tumor was in a dangerous location - one wrong move during surgery could cause paralysis or death.

Meredith wasn't assigned to the case, but she couldn't stay away. She stood outside the operating room, watching through the glass window. Her heart pounded as she saw Derek make the first incision. The surgery was delicate and complex. Derek worked with steady hands, removing the tumor millimeter by millimeter.

"Please be careful," Meredith whispered to herself. "Come back to me."

The surgery lasted seven hours. Meredith paced the waiting room, drinking coffee and trying not to worry. She thought about how much Derek meant to her. He made her feel alive, special, and loved. But their secret relationship also made her anxious. What if someone found out? What if they got caught?

Finally, the doors opened. Derek emerged, looking exhausted but triumphant. "The tumor is out," he announced to the waiting family. "Robert should make a full recovery."

Meredith wanted to hug him right there in the hallway, but she couldn't. Instead, she found him later in the doctors' lounge, a quiet room where doctors could relax between cases.

"You were amazing today," Meredith said softly, closing the door behind her.

Derek smiled wearily. "Thanks. It was touch and go for a while there. I kept thinking about you the whole time."

They shared a brief, stolen kiss. It was risky - anyone could walk in. But in that moment, it was worth it.

Their relationship wasn't just about romance. Derek supported Meredith's career goals. He encouraged her to pursue difficult cases and believed in her abilities. Meredith helped Derek stay grounded. She reminded him that patients were people, not just medical puzzles.

But secrets have a way of coming out. Dr. Izzie Stevens, who was perceptive and caring, started to notice the way Meredith and Derek looked at each other. During lunch one day, Izzie pulled Meredith aside.

"Are you and Derek... you know... together?" Izzie asked quietly.

Meredith's heart skipped a beat. "What? No! We're just colleagues. Why would you think that?"

Izzie raised an eyebrow. "The way you look at each other. It's not just professional. And I saw you coming out of the lounge together yesterday."

"We're just friends," Meredith insisted, but her voice shook slightly. "Please don't say anything. It could ruin everything."

Izzie nodded slowly. "I won't tell anyone. But be careful, Meredith. Hospital romances can be dangerous."

Meredith knew Izzie was right. She and Derek decided to be even more careful. They met outside the hospital sometimes, in quiet parks or restaurants far from work. But the secrecy was hard. It made their love feel stolen and fragile.

As Meredith walked home that evening, she wondered how long they could keep their relationship hidden. Love in a hospital was beautiful but risky. Every day brought new challenges - medical emergencies, ethical dilemmas, and now the constant fear of discovery.

Yet Meredith wouldn't trade it for anything. Derek made her happier than she'd ever been. Their love gave her strength to face the difficulties of being a doctor. And that was worth any risk.

## Chapter 4: The Miracle Baby
## 4 Skyrius: Stebuklingas Kūdikis

Dr. Addison Montgomery was a world-renowned neonatal specialist who had recently joined Seattle Grace Hospital. She was brilliant, sophisticated, and brought a wealth of experience from treating the tiniest and most fragile patients. Addison specialized in high-risk pregnancies and complicated deliveries.

One Tuesday morning, Addison received an urgent case. Lisa Thompson, a 32-year-old first-time mother, was brought to the maternity ward. Lisa was 35 weeks pregnant, but something was terribly wrong. Her baby wasn't growing properly in the womb. The fetus was severely underdeveloped, and Lisa's amniotic fluid was low.

"I've been trying to have a baby for five years," Lisa sobbed when Addison examined her. "This is my last chance. Please save my baby!"

Addison performed an emergency ultrasound. The results were concerning. The baby had intrauterine growth restriction - it wasn't getting enough nutrients. "The baby is in distress," Addison explained gently. "We need to deliver immediately. There's a risk the baby won't survive outside the womb."

Lisa's husband, Tom, held her hand tightly. "Whatever it takes," he said. "Just save our baby."

Dr. Meredith Grey was assigned to assist Addison. Meredith had always been fascinated by obstetrics, though it could be heartbreaking work. The team prepared for an emergency cesarean section.

In the operating room, the atmosphere was tense. Addison made the incision carefully. "The baby is very small," she said. "Heart rate is dropping."

Meredith monitored the fetal heart rate closely. "Come on, little one," she whispered. "Fight for us."

Addison delivered the baby - a tiny boy weighing just 1.8 kilograms. He was premature and needed immediate intensive care. His skin was translucent, his breathing shallow. The neonatal team rushed him to the NICU (intensive care unit for newborns).

Lisa woke up from anesthesia desperate for news. "My baby? Is he okay?"

Addison sat beside her. "He's alive, but critical. We're doing everything we can. He's a fighter."

For the next 48 hours, it was touch and go. The baby had breathing difficulties and needed a ventilator. Addison and Meredith took turns monitoring him around the clock. Meredith brought Lisa breast milk every few hours, even when Lisa was exhausted.

On the third day, a miracle happened. The baby began breathing on his own. His vital signs stabilized. Addison removed the ventilator. "He's going to make it," she announced.

Lisa was allowed to hold her son for the first time. She wept tears of joy as she cradled the tiny baby against her chest. "Hello, my little miracle," she whispered. "You're perfect."

Tom joined them, his eyes filled with tears. "Thank you," he told the doctors. "You gave us our family."

Addison hugged Meredith tightly. "We did it! We saved two lives today."

Meredith felt a deep sense of accomplishment. This was why she became a doctor - to witness miracles and help create families.

But medicine isn't always about happy endings. Later that afternoon, Meredith was called to comfort an elderly woman named Mrs. Patterson. Mrs. Patterson had lived a full 87 years, but cancer had finally taken its toll. Her children gathered around her bed as she took her last breath.

"I'm so sorry," Meredith said softly, holding the family's hands. "She was a remarkable woman. She lived a long, loving life."

One of the daughters nodded through tears. "She was our miracle too. Thank you for being here."

As Meredith left the room, she reflected on the day. Birth and death, joy and sorrow - they were two sides of the same coin in medicine. But moments like saving the miracle baby made all the difficult days worthwhile.

Hospital life has both joy and sorrow (liūdesys).

## Chapter 5: Friendship and Support
## 5 Skyrius: Draugystė ir Palaikymas

Dr. Cristina Yang had always been the strongest person Meredith knew. Cristina was brilliant, focused, and never showed weakness. But today, everything changed. Cristina's patient, a 55-year-old man named George, died on the operating table during open-heart surgery.

The surgery had started well. Cristina and her team worked perfectly, repairing George's damaged heart valve. But during the final stages, George's heart stopped. Despite 45 minutes of CPR and every medical intervention, they couldn't bring him back.

Cristina stood frozen in the OR, staring at the flat line on the monitor. "No," she whispered. "This can't be happening." Tears streamed down her face as she realized she had lost her first patient.

In the scrub room, Cristina broke down completely. She slumped against the wall, sobbing uncontrollably. "I killed him," she gasped. "I was too slow. I missed something."

Dr. Meredith Grey found her friend and immediately knew something was wrong. Cristina's eyes were red, her hands were shaking. Without a word, Meredith led Cristina to the empty doctors' lounge and closed the door.

"What happened?" Meredith asked gently, handing Cristina a tissue.

Cristina could barely speak through her sobs. "George died. On my table. I tried everything, but it wasn't enough. What if I'm not cut out for this? What if I hurt more people?"

Meredith pulled Cristina into a tight hug. "Listen to me. You're an amazing surgeon. Everyone loses patients sometimes. It's not your fault. You did everything right."

Dr. Alex Karev walked in and saw the scene. Alex was usually sarcastic and kept his distance, but today he sat down beside them. "Cristina, you were incredible in there. The valve was too damaged. No one could have saved him. Don't blame yourself."

Just then, Dr. Izzie Stevens entered with a tray of coffee and sandwiches. She had heard what happened and wanted to help. "We're all here for you," Izzie said, handing Cristina a cup. "Remember when I lost my first patient? You helped me through it. Now it's our turn."

The four friends sat together for over an hour. They shared stories of their own failures and fears. Cristina talked about her immigrant parents who sacrificed everything so she could become a doctor. Meredith confessed her insecurities about being "the daughter of a famous surgeon." Alex admitted he sometimes felt like an imposter. Izzie shared her worries about balancing medicine with her personal life.

Gradually, Cristina's sobs turned to quiet tears, then to steady breathing. "Thank you," she said finally. "I don't know what I'd do without you all."

"That's what friends are for," Meredith replied. "We're a family here."

As the group dispersed back to work, Meredith reflected on how important these friendships were. Hospital work was brutal - long hours, life-and-death decisions, constant stress. But having people who understood made it bearable.

Cristina returned to her duties with renewed determination. She would honor George's memory by becoming an even better surgeon. And she knew that no matter what challenges came next, she had friends who would be there.

In the world of medicine, losses were inevitable. But so was the support that made healing possible.

## Chapter 6: New Beginnings
## 6 Skyrius: Nauji Pradžiai

Two years had passed since Meredith's first day at Seattle Grace Hospital. The nervous intern had become a confident surgeon. She had faced countless emergencies, lost patients she couldn't save, and celebrated victories that seemed miraculous. Through it all, Meredith had grown stronger, more compassionate, and deeply committed to her calling.

One crisp autumn morning, a new group of interns arrived. Among them was Dr. Lexie Grey, a bright-eyed 25-year-old with an infectious enthusiasm. As Meredith reviewed the interns' files, she froze. Lexie Grey. The name was familiar. Too familiar.

During orientation, Meredith pulled Lexie aside. "Your last name is Grey?" she asked, trying to keep her voice steady.

Lexie nodded excitedly. "Yes! Dr. Ellis Grey was my mother. She passed away a few years ago. I came to Seattle Grace because this was her hospital."

Meredith's heart raced. Dr. Ellis Grey had been her mother too - a brilliant surgeon who chose her career over her family. Meredith had never known she had a half-sister. "I'm... I'm Meredith," she stammered. "Meredith Grey. Your half-sister."

Lexie's eyes widened in shock and joy. "You? My sister? This is incredible!" They embraced, both women crying happy tears.

The sisters spent hours talking that night. Lexie shared stories of their mother's brilliance and occasional coldness. Meredith confessed how Ellis's abandonment had shaped her life. Despite the pain of their mother's choices, they found comfort in each other.

At work, Meredith mentored Lexie, teaching her the intricacies of surgical procedures and patient care. Lexie was eager, intelligent, and brought fresh energy to the team. "You're going to be an amazing doctor," Meredith told her.

Meanwhile, Meredith's relationship with Derek had deepened. After years of secrecy and challenges, Derek planned the perfect proposal. One evening, as the sun set over the hospital garden, he got down on one knee. "Meredith Grey, will you marry me?"

Tears streamed down Meredith's face as she nodded. "Yes," she whispered. "A thousand times yes."

Their wedding was intimate and beautiful, held in the very garden where they first confessed their love. Cristina was Meredith's maid of honor, Alex walked Derek down the aisle, and Izzie handled the flowers. Even Dr. Webber, though retired, officiated the ceremony.

But hospital life never stopped. Even on their wedding day, there was an emergency appendectomy that Derek had to perform. "Duty calls," he said with a smile.

Dr. Richard Webber's retirement created another change. The board appointed Dr. Owen Hunt as the new chief of surgery. Owen was a military trauma surgeon - intense, disciplined, and sometimes intimidating.

Change brought growth, Meredith realized. Lexie's arrival healed old wounds. Her marriage to Derek brought stability. Owen's leadership brought new energy. Some chapters ended, but new ones began.

As Meredith looked around at her wedding reception - her new husband, her sister, her friends - she felt truly blessed. Seattle Grace had taken her in as a stranger and given her a family. The hospital wasn't just a workplace; it was home.

Meredith thought about her journey. From a nervous intern to a confident doctor. From alone to having a family. The hospital had changed her life.

"I love this place," Meredith said. "It's where I found myself."

## Chapter 7: The Big Storm
## 7 Skyrius: Didžioji Audra

Seattle was hit by the worst storm in decades. Hurricane-force winds howled through the city, rain lashed against windows, and power lines snapped like twigs. Seattle Grace Hospital became a beacon in the chaos, its emergency generators humming as the main power grid failed.

Dr. Meredith Grey was on the night shift when the storm reached its peak. Lightning illuminated the darkened hospital as patients poured in with storm-related injuries. A construction worker had fallen from scaffolding, his arm mangled by the wind. A mother and her teenage daughter arrived with severe hypothermia after their car skidded off the road. An elderly man suffered a heart attack from the stress.

The hospital's main power failed completely. Emergency lights flickered on, casting eerie shadows through the corridors. Meredith coordinated the chaos from the ER desk. "We need to prioritize!" she called out. "Trauma room 1 for the fall victim, room 2 for the hypothermic patients!"

Dr. Cristina Yang took charge of the construction worker's surgery. "His brachial artery is severed," she announced. "We need to operate immediately." But the backup generators could only power essential equipment. The operating room lights were dim, and the anesthesia machines beeped warnings.

Cristina worked by flashlight, her hands steady despite the circumstances. "Hold that light steady," she ordered her scrub nurse. The surgery was tense but successful. The man would regain use of his arm after extensive rehabilitation.

Meanwhile, Dr. Izzie Stevens tended to the frightened patients. A young boy, separated from his parents in the storm, sobbed uncontrollably. Izzie sat with him, holding his hand. "The storm can't hurt you here," she said softly. "We're safe inside. Your parents are looking for you right now."

Dr. Alex Karev helped an elderly woman who had been trapped in her basement during flooding. "I thought I was going to die," she whispered. Alex held her hand. "You're safe now," he reassured her. "We're going to take good care of you."

The storm raged for 18 hours. Doctors and nurses worked without breaks, fueled by coffee and determination. Meredith coordinated supplies, Cristina performed emergency surgeries, Izzie comforted the scared, and Alex handled the most critical cases.

When dawn broke, the storm had passed. The hospital was battered - windows cracked, ceilings leaking - but structurally sound. More importantly, every patient who came through the doors had survived.

Meredith gathered her friends in the now-bright cafeteria. "We did it," she said, hugging each of them. "We kept everyone safe."

Cristina nodded wearily. "Storms come and go, but what we did here lasts."

Alex managed a small smile. "Who knew I could be a hero?"

Izzie squeezed their hands. "We all were heroes today."

The storm tested their limits, but it also revealed their strength. In the face of nature's fury, the doctors of Seattle Grace stood united. Their bonds, forged in crisis, were unbreakable.

As cleanup crews repaired the damage, Meredith reflected on the night's events. Storms destroyed and storms healed. This one had brought her team closer than ever.

## Chapter 8: Dreams and Reality
## 8 Skyrius: Svajonės ir Tikrovė

Dr. Meredith Grey had a dream. She wanted to be the best surgeon. But reality was different. Medicine was hard work.

One day, a famous doctor visited Seattle Grace. Dr. Catherine Avery was a legend (legenda). She was Derek's mother!

Catherine watched Meredith operate. "You're talented," she said. "But you need more experience."

Meredith felt proud but also unsure. "I want to be great," she said.

Catherine gave advice. "Medicine is about heart and skill. Never give up."

Meredith thought about her dreams. She wanted to save lives and help people. But she also wanted a family.

Derek supported her. "You can have both," he said.

Dr. Cristina Yang had dreams too. She wanted to be a heart surgeon. She studied hard.

Alex wanted to be better. He was rude sometimes, but he cared about patients.

Izzie dreamed of helping poor people. She wanted to be a better doctor.

Dreams keep doctors going. But reality teaches them to be strong.

Meredith learned that being a doctor means balancing dreams and reality.
