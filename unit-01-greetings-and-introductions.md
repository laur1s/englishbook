## Cultural Notes / Kultūrinės pastabos

In English-speaking countries, greetings have subtle rules that are good to know.

- **Formality:** "Hello" is a neutral greeting suitable for anyone. "Hi" is a friendly, common greeting for most informal and semi-formal situations. "Hey" is very informal and best used with friends and people you know well.
- **The "How are you?" Ritual:** "How are you?" is often a part of the greeting itself, not a deep question about your well-being.
  - A typical, polite response is: "I'm good, thanks. And you?" or "Fine, thank you. How are you?"
  - It's not common to respond with a long list of your problems unless you know the person very well.
- **Handshakes:** A firm handshake is common when meeting someone for the first time in a professional or formal setting. It's usually brief. Among friends, handshakes are less common; a simple "hello" is enough.
- **First Names:** Using first names (e.g., "John," "Mary") is very common, even with people in positions of authority like managers or teachers, after the initial introduction. This is different from Lithuania, where formal titles are used more often.
- **Eye Contact:** Making eye contact when you greet someone shows that you are confident and sincere. Avoiding eye contact can be seen as impolite or shy.

## Additional Cultural Notes / Papildomos kultūrinės pastabos

- **Personal Space:** In English-speaking countries, people usually stand about an arm's length apart when talking. This is closer than in some other cultures, but farther than in very close relationships.
- **Small Talk:** After introductions, people often make small talk about weather, work, or hobbies. Questions like "How's the weather?" or "Did you have a good weekend?" are common.
- **Business Cards:** In professional settings, especially in Asia-influenced English contexts, exchanging business cards is important. In Western countries, it's less formal, but having a card ready is good.
- **Follow-up:** After meeting someone, it's polite to say "It was great meeting you" or "Let's stay in touch" if you want to continue the connection.
